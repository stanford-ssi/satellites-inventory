QR Code Scanner Requirements:

1. QR Code Format: [website]/qrcode/[part_id]
   - Uses human-readable part_id (not UUIDs)
   - Any camera can scan and open the URL

2. QR Code Route Handler: /qrcode/[part_id]
   - Redirects to scanner page with part info
   - Automatically loads inventory item by part_id

3. Inventory Actions:
   - Checkout/Take Out: Remove items from inventory
   - Return: Add items back to inventory
   - Adjustment (Admin only): Set exact stock levels

4. Authentication Handling:
   - Authenticated users: Use their profile
   - Unauthenticated users: Must enter their name

5. Transaction Form:
   - Quantity input with validation
   - Optional notes field
   - Action selection (checkout/return/adjust)
   - Error handling and success feedback

6. Database Operations:
   - Update inventory quantity
   - Create transaction records with user_id, type, quantity, notes
   - Use part_id for lookups (not UUIDs)

Note: No need for built-in camera scanner - use external QR apps that open URLs.
