Clean white background, black text, customizable primary colors

Database Schema:
sqlinventory: id, part_id, description, bin_id, location_within_bin, quantity, part_link, qr_code
users: id, email, role (admin/member), name
transactions: id, part_id, user_id, type (checkout/return), quantity, timestamp
Authentication:

Supabase Auth (email/password)
Simple roles: Admin (full access) vs Member (checkout only)

MVP Features (in order):

Add/edit parts (admin only)
Low stock indicators


QR System

Auto-generate QR codes for parts
QR scanner for checkout/return
Transaction logging


Dashboard

UI Requirements:

Use shadcn/ui components throughout, but with far less padding (should be compact)
Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
CSS custom properties for easy theming:

css  :root {
    --primary: /* customizable */
    --background: white;
    --foreground: black;
  }
Build this as a clean, functional MVP. Start with milestone 1, include Supabase setup instructions and Vercel deployment config.
